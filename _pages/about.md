I am David, a senior at Wesleyan University currently working on the debris disk around AU Microscopii and on simulations of high-redshift galaxies. I am currently applying for fellowships and to graduate school programs in Astronomy. My research interests are robust but I am generally interested in the early universe and in astrophysical modelling/simulations. 

A brief biography
======
I am a quadruplet, and a Brooklyn native. I graduated high school in 2017 and attended Wesleyan University, where I expect to graduate in May 2021 as a Astronomy and Physics double major. In my free time I write and record heavy music, play piano and guitar, study chess, and dabble in old school RPGs.
