Hello! I am David, a senior at Wesleyan University. I am a undergraduate researcher currently working on circumstellar disks and on high-redshift galaxies. I am currently applying for fellowships and to graduate school programs in Astronomy. My research interests are robust but I am generally interested in the early universe and in astrophysical modelling/simulations. 

My background
======

I began studying at Wesleyan University in September 2017. In the summer of 2018 I worked in Prof. Meredith Hughes's "Disk Detectives" group, combining modelling codes for eccentric protoplanetary disks and circular debris disks to model eccentric debris disks. In this group I am currently investigating the grain-size dependent physics and the vertical structure of the debris disk around AU Microscopii. I was an undergraduate research fellow at the Cosmic Dawn Center in Copenhagen, Denmark during the summer of 2019, where I began work with Prof. Thomas Greve on simulating line emission in high-redshift galaxies. This project received the Chambliss Award from the American Astronomical Society in January 2020. I will be receiving my BA in Astronomy and Physics in May 2021. 

My hobbies
======

Beyond astrophysics, I am a lifelong musician, classically trained in piano and a self-taught guitarist and drummer. In my free time I enjoy writing and performing heavy music with friends. I also study chess in my free time and play in local club tournaments whenever I'm home. Lastly, I am a fan of sci-fi video games and of old-school RPGs.
